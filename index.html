                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Reilly, I am a rising Junior (Class of 2023) and an AMS/CS double major. I am an active member of the SBCS (I've really enjoyed the daily programming questions by Avish), 
                        and would like to serve as the club's Webmaster next year. For a more thorough introduction to me, I suggest going to my website: <a href="https://rajalo.github.io">rajalo.github.io</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id = "experience" class="hidden">
                    <h1>Experience</h1>
                    <p>
                        So far, the majority of my web development experience has come from taking CSE 316 with Prof. McKenna. Otherwise my best feat of 
                        web development is probably <a href="https://rajalo.github.io">my personal website</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a lot of experience using Javascript specifically, as it is the language used for Google Apps Script. I've used that to create GroupMe Bots and various club management systems, the latter of which I have on my github- <a href="https://github.com/Rajalo/Club-Management-Systems">https://github.com/Rajalo/Club-Management-Systems</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id = "suggestions" class="hidden">
                    <h1>Suggestions</h1>
                    <p> In my opinion, the main problems our current website has are
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Static Feel</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Lack of Interactivity</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Minimal Information about what's currently going on</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some ideas I have to address these problems
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Add some basic animations such as to the logo.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Separate the information into distinct tabs rather than a single page</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Add a Member Creations tab</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Add more information about the current eboard members</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I have made a <a href="/mocksite/">mocksite which can hopefully convey what I mean </a>
